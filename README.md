# Project Part 2: First Sprint
## Sprint Planning
|Task|Our Submission|
|-------|-------------|
| Document your sprint forecast and rationale in README | Our first sprint has two stories totalling 13 points. These stories were selected based on how they will satisfy the preconditions of getting our infrastructure set up and getting a user logged in. As our first sprint we don't have any prior evidence for how many points we can do in a sprint, so we came to a conservative consensus at 13. |
| Pull appropriate stories into sprint backlog | https://github.com/Best-Team-Forever/ClassProject/blob/main/doc/SprintBacklog.jpg |
| Ensure stories are right-sized | Based on our estimating activity we believe our first two stories of 8 and 5 will be correct for our team. |
| Decompose stories into tasks | We put our tasks in the story description. See screenshot: <br> https://github.com/Best-Team-Forever/ClassProject/blob/main/doc/storySubTasks.jpg |
| Set up a kanban board for sprint backlog | We are using Jira for the kanban board. See screenshot: <br> https://github.com/Best-Team-Forever/ClassProject/blob/main/doc/kanban.jpg |
